	  <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
	  <p class="places">I was born in Texas but I grew up in California, both up north in the Bay Area and in SoCal around LA and Orange County. Because of that I've almost always ever only known warmth and relaxation which I believe falls right in line with my personality. Had a brief foray into seeing what seasons are when I endured the harsh winter months of Chicago for college, but I'm back in California currently. Seeing snow was fun but I think I'm just fine with seeing the sun every day now while I learn to program.</p>

	  <h2>About Me</h2>
	  <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
	  <p class="ans">I really enjoy playing basketball and following the nba. I follow most other sports as well. I also love watching movies although it seems that lately I keep track of movies instead of actually watching them. This is through watching practically every major trailer that comes out and keeping tabs on box office results every Sunday. I also just like learning random things in general which is why I frequent reddit although I'm not sure redditing counts as a hobbie. I hope to incorporate all my interests once my web development skills are up to par!</p>
	  <h3>Whats your dream job?</h3>
	  <p class="ans">This! Well once it translates into something I can consider a job I think it will be really fulfilling.</p>
	  <h3>Whats your background?</h3>
	  <p class="ans">Not much but I'm getting "there!"</p>
	  <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
	  <p class="ans">Lately I've been listening to one hour loops of a single EDM song and loops of electronic music in general. I find that it matches the mood of programming really well and helps me focus. I think it tricks my brain into feeling simulated so I don't go looking for other distractions.  </p>
